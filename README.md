cucumber and benchmarks, what could go wrong

# everything can be described this way

Actors perceiving something and performing actions is so fundamental, that you can describe a lot of requirements that way. As soon as you have the process codified, you can check some things. 

I am no performance expert in any way, so i naively i would say: when runnning a stress test, I expect some things to hold true regarding throughput or response times or auto scale behavior or... A bunch of things that i do require. And to check that, we build up an environment with certain preconditions. We simulate scenarios, gather evidence, check certain metrics, explore the stage and other scenarios 

Map this to arrange act assert and you got

Make scenarios relatable
